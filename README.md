# Swoosh   
## Motivation
```
Swoosh was thought of when I sat down in the same barber shop for the nth time and I wondered why I havent gone to a better place even though I wanted to for a long time. I was either lazy, shy or just hesitant to call a salon or a botique. 
That is when I thought I will start to work on an app for listing salons.

Code will be improved over time.
Redux needs to be implemented to create a more scalable app.
A Web Application will also be built in the next version
